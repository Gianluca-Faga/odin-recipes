        <li>150 g All-purpose flour (Type 00)</li>
        <li>250 g Spinach</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>

        <li>300 g Beef (coarsely ground mixed beef)</li>
        <li>150 g Pancetta</li>
        <li>50 g Carrots</li>
        <li>50 g Celery</li>
        <li>50 g Golden onions</li>
        <li>100 g Red wine</li>
        <li>300 g Tomato passata</li>
        <li>Vegetable broth, as needed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>70 g Butter</li>
        <li>70 g All-purpose flour (Type 00)</li>
        <li>1 liter Whole milk</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Nutmeg, to taste</li>
        <li>Butter, as needed</li>
        <li>270 g Parmigiano Reggiano cheese</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>  
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the vegetable broth and keep it warm.</li>
        <li>Take the pancetta, cut it into strips, and finely chop it.</li>
        <li>Prepare a fine mixture with carrots, onions, and celery, and set it aside.</li>
        <li>In a saucepan, pour a drizzle of oil and add the pancetta. Sauté it well for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Then add the vegetable mixture and sauté for 5-6 minutes to enhance the flavors.</li>
        <li>Add the ground meat, mix well, and increase the heat. Let the meat brown slowly, sealing the juices and becoming tender.</li>
        <li>Deglaze with red wine and wait for it to completely evaporate.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato puree and stir. The ragù should cook for two hours. Once it starts boiling again, add a little hot broth, one or two ladles. Then let the ragù cook for at least two hours.</li>
        <li>You should cook it with the lid on, but not completely closed. Check and stir occasionally, adding more broth if needed, and let it cook for the indicated time.</li>
        <li>Place the spinach in a pan, add a little water, cover with a lid, and let it cook until wilted, approximately 5-6 minutes in total.</li>
        <li>At this point, drain the spinach, let it cool down, and squeeze out the excess water.</li>
        <li>Transfer the spinach to a blender and puree until you obtain 100 g of spinach puree.</li>
        <li>Now, on a work surface, place the semolina and all-purpose flour, add the spinach puree, and create a well in the center.</li>
        <li>Add the lightly beaten eggs and egg yolks to the well.</li>
        <li>Start kneading from the center, so that the eggs don't spill out of the well. Knead well until you obtain a homogeneous dough.</li>
        <li>Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, heat the milk without boiling it.</li>
        <li>In another pan, melt the butter. Add the flour all at once and cook for a few minutes until you get a golden roux.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour the warm milk into the pan, stirring well.</li>
        <li>Add salt and flavor with nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Continue stirring until you obtain a creamy béchamel sauce.</li>
        <li>Transfer the sauce to a bowl, cover it with plastic wrap placed directly on the surface, and set it aside.</li>
        <li>After the 30 minutes have passed, take the dough and cut off a piece. Cover the remaining dough with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out.</li>
        <li>
            
                Using a little semolina to prevent sticking, flatten the dough slightly on the work surface to form a rectangle and roll out the pasta using a pasta machine.
                <br> 
                Start with a thicker setting, then fold the dough onto itself and pass it through again. When it becomes too moist, dust it with some semolina. 
                <br> 
                Gradually reduce the thickness until you obtain a sheet slightly over half a millimeter thick. Transfer it to a work surface and cut it into 30x20 cm (12x8 inch) rectangles. 
                <br> 
                Continue in this way until you finish the dough, and in the meantime, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. 
                <br> 
                When it starts boiling, cook one sheet at a time, wait for 30-40 seconds, and using a slotted spoon, drain it. 
                <br> 
                Transfer it to a tray with a kitchen towel and pat it dry to remove excess water. 
                <br> 
                Continue in this way, placing the cooked sheets side by side without overlapping them.                
            
        </li>
        <li>Once the ragù is ready, adjust the salt and pepper seasoning and proceed with assembling the lasagna.</li>
        <li>
                Take a large 30x20 cm (12x8 inch) lasagna dish and butter the bottom. Add a thin layer of béchamel sauce and a layer of ragù. 
                <br> 
                Then place the first sheet of pasta, add a layer of béchamel sauce and ragù. Add grated Parmesan cheese and place another sheet of pasta on top. 
                <br> 
                Repeat this process, alternating layers of béchamel sauce, ragù, and grated cheese, until you have five layers. 
                <br> 
                After placing the last sheet, cover it completely with ragù. 
                <br> 
                Sprinkle with grated cheese, add small pieces of butter, and bake in a preheated static oven at 170°C (340°F) for 40 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>The Bolognese lasagna is ready to be served.</li>
